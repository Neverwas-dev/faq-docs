While ShapeShift was a company, it had an in-depth Information Security Policy that all employees needed to follow, and a robust Security Training program for all new hires.

In this directory you'll find copies of this policy and training materials.

We hope that these documents are helpful for any other companies or DAOs to learn from while creating their own infosec policies and security training programs.

Stay safe out there!
